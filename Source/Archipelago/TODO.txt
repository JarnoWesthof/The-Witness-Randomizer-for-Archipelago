BUGS:

major:
receicing multiple items at once does not correctly reset temporary effects like poweresurge

minor: 
tetris briges are on
bunker door is on, should be disabled not missing, town symmmetry is not off // Missing seems to take priority over disabled

hopefully fixed:
quary stones 1 (1367) is calculated as stones & erazors, but should be colored stones & erazors
left monastary door panel is off
quarry lazer didnt say missing shapers
ship vault has both colored dots aswel as sound dots
