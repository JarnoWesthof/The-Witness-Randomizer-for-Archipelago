BUGS:

major:
receicing multiple items at once does not correctly reset temporary effects like poweresurge

minor: 

hopefully fixed:
quary stones 1 (1367) is calculated as stones & erazors, but should be colored stones & erazors
left monastary door panel is off
keep pressure plates dont respect locking policies
quarry lazer didnt say missing shapers
tetris briges are on
ship vault has both colored dots aswel as sound dots   
bunker door is on, should be disabled not missing, town symmmetry is not off // Missing seems to take priority over disabled
