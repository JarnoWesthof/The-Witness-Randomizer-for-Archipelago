Hello, Welcome to The Witness Randomizer Variety Mode. It features some puzzles from Sigma's Radndomizers, including new mechanics. It also featuers various puzzles types I made, waiting for you to find out.

If you haven't tried the Sigma's Random Puzzle Generator, you can get one from here too: https://github.com/Penguin12335/witness-randomizer

__Game Mode__ :
**Variety** : Normal Mode features Normal and Expert Puzzles from Sigma's and New puzzle types I made. (Speedrun Welcome)
**Inferno** : Cruel Mode features Big Grids with Load of Symbols. For those who seek Witness Madness.  (Speedrun Optional)

__**Are you up to the Challenge?**__

**Reminder**
1) Due to the large amount of content, you have to wait for few minutes to fully randomized.
2) I strongly advice close the randomizer before close the game to prevent program error.
3) to re-randomized, I suggest reopen the game first to randomized again.

If there's any issues or errors spotted, please report to the issue forum

Good Luck, Player One!
