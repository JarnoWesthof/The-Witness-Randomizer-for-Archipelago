Hello, Welcome to The Witness Randomizer Variety Mode. It features some puzzles from Sigma's Radndomizers, including new mechanics. It also features various puzzles types I made, waiting for you to find out.

If you haven't tried Sigma's Random Puzzle Generator, you can get one from here too: https://github.com/Penguin12335/witness-randomizer

Variety: Normal Mode features Normal and Expert Puzzles from Sigma's and New puzzle types I made. (Speedrun Welcome)

Inferno: Cruel Mode features Big Grids with a Load of Symbols. For those who seek Witness Madness.  (Speedrun Optional)

**Are you up to the Challenge?**

**Reminder**
1) Due to a large amount of content, you have to wait for a few minutes to be fully randomise.
2) I strongly advise closing the randomizer before closing the game to prevent program errors.
3) to re-randomise, I suggest reopening the game first to randomise again.

If there are any issues or errors spotted, please report them to the issue forum

Good Luck, Player One!
